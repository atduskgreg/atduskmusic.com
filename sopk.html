		<h2>Lyrics</h2>
		
		<h3><a name="the_deep_end">The Deep End</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/1.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
		Quarters and dimes<br />
		More than half of my life I've been dreaming of two things, not one<br />
		this year included<br />
		So much to do, so little time<br />
		I have been sleeping breathlessly till now
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		I could have chosen anything<br />
		But here we are I've chosen this<br />
		It's what I'd do again
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Islands and the sea<br />
		The winds of change don't blow for me<br />
		Meanwhile it's clear I've been away too long<br />
		And yet I stay<br />
		There is simply no way to know<br />
		So we cross our fingers now
		</p>
		<p class="bridge">
		No matter that it's been much longer than we thought<br />
		The winter never came
		</p>
		<p class="coda">
		Seasons never do change regardless of the range<br />
		I know this better than before<br />
		The cat that came back in<br />
		You know that you have always been this for me once and again<br />
		Swingsets in our old park<br />
		To this day they bear the mark of warm weather that was well-spent<br />
		And so it's been.
		</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a name="sports">Sports</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/3.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="pre-chorus">
		And if clouds come<br />
		We'll just play anyway<br />
		We'll teach everyone how to spend their sunny day
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		Slipping well beneath your radar<br />
		Crawling through your backyard<br />
		I could not convince you<br />
		Make-believe, unspoken<br />
		Ancient vows we've broken<br />
		I could not convince you
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Coming down, I stayed away<br />
		They insisted the sun was coming out today<br />
		We're gonna need good weather for what I have planned<br />
		Leave behind the things that you don't want<br />
		Our intentions were always just an afterthought<br />
		I hope you think that this is funny, because I do
		</p>
		<p class="coda">
		Tongues engaged in stealing<br />
		Blatantly revealing<br />
		All connections severed<br />
		Justified forever<br />
		It's the only sport left with no out-of-bounds.
		</p>

		<h3><a name="rain_in_the_house">Rain in the House</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/2.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">

		<p class="verse">
		Eras come again sweetly<br />
		The night is but a frame<br />
		This tiger is now tame
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Purpose, a month without language<br />
		Violets in the rain<br />
		Our state is on the wane
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		There's rain in the house, I cut myself<br />
		There's rain in the house on March twelfth<br />
		There's rain in the house, I wish you were<br />
		There's rain in the house, I'm quite sure
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Water will ever pursue us<br />
		This evening is bewitched<br />
		The trailer slept unhitched
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Songs about a song<br />
		There's magic in this wire<br />
		To eat and to perspire
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Cascade: it's green, I have seen it<br />
		The night is but a frame<br />
		This tiger is now tame
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Lamplight: the neighbors are silent<br />
		Violets in the rain<br />
		Our state is on the wane.

		<h3><a name="tilted_floors">Tilted Floors (Were All We Knew)</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/5.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
		High, Low, fresh snow<br />
		Nights spent on the highway refrained in my driveway<br />
		And in sequence<br />
		I won all your secrets, you couldn't keep its<br />
		Name straight, too late<br />
		Curfew's in effect now, I cannot suspect now<br />
		Clean swept, bereft<br />
		Of all old traces, you kept your spaces
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		All this time, rewind<br />
		Calendar inured<br />
		Autumn Grounds<br />
		It felt true<br />
		California seemed important<br />
		Oh home, home home
		</p>
		<p class="bridge">
		I think I'm getting the knack<br />
		Of running like a train on a circular track<br />
		Returning to the places I'd wished I forgot<br />
		And leaving my reflection to carry the thought
		</p>
		<p class="coda">
		Three coasts and five years<br />
		I can't keep my memory clear and it's a shame<br />
		Coffee shops, corduroy<br />
		My backyard and summer joys won't come to naught<br />
		L.A. was all I knew<br />
		Couldn't seem to follow through because of you<br />
		Hubcaps and klezmer blues<br />
		Tilted floors were all we knew, and this cannot simply end.

		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/6.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p class="intro">
			Thanks for coming<br/>
			Now let's see you<br/>
			Find your way through
			</p>
			<p class="verse">
			Well-made decisions, knew you could<br/>
			Gentle revisions, yours and mine<br/>
			Layered gone outside, cold at night<br/>
			In case of romance, chandeliers
			</p>
			<p class="bridge">
			We're lost on the highway
			And too shy to stop and ask for help
			So turn on your headlights, and we'll find our way home by ourselves
			</p>
			<p class="coda">
			Beneath the surface of our Persephone
			There lies a false sense of insecurity
			An observation of ancient sympathy
			Is what comprises our dear Persephone.

		<h3><a name="the_image">The Image</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/7.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
		I really had an awful scare<br />
		The moment I went up the stairs<br />
		The ribbons looping through your hair, tied with so much grace<br />
		I stood there while you found your purse<br />
		Then we ran out of universe<br />
		An unexpected sounding burst left me naked
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		Waiting in the sideways rain<br />
		For somebody to say my name, and nobody does<br />
		Waiting in the sideways rain as anyone would
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		I'm living in the by and by<br />
		I can't remember how to lie<br />
		The clothes I wore that won't come dry hang around my room<br />
		They're waiting for a glimpse of sun<br />
		Or someone with a loaded gun<br />
		I guess we had ourselves some fun but now it's over
		</p>
		<p clas="coda">
		Believe in what you see, believe in what you hear<br />
		While you remain unfazed, the fabric disappears<br />
		I should have taken notes<br />
		I wish I'd kept my head<br />
		I wish I hadn't seen the image fade to red.

				I don't want you to
				Know where it is that I have been
				Come back to my room
				lai dai dai dai dai dai dai
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				Can you hear the rain
				Or can you see it on my face
				I can't leave this place
				lai dai dai dai dai dai dai
				</p>
				<p class="bridge">
					Still the breeze that moves the sunlit leaves
					Warm the grass and wet the earth beneath

					I can't feel your skin
					But I can still recall its shape
					When you're far away
					lai dai dai dai dai dai dai
					When you're far away

		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/10.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
		From the beginning, silence has slept<br />
		This is the summer of promises kept<br />
		Let it stay just this way<br />
		A thousand years and nothing's changed
		</p>
		<p class="chours">
		It's OK, I see the sun<br />
		The winds will blow where the freeways run, and grace all the beaches and canyons<br />
		In the name of what we've done<br />
		We call upon almost everyone to remember fallen companions; it's understood
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		This is a prayer for what can't be said<br />
		For all that we've hoped for and done instead<br />
		Going back to what I knew<br />
		My oldest hopes come back to me
		</p>
		<p class="coda">
		And I lay my head down and leave this book unread<br />
		And I lay my head down and put this dream to bed<br />
		And it's all right now.

		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="coda">
		Every morning people in the city climb out of bed<br />
		Unaware of other people watching from overhead<br />
		Nothing in this world is ever truly quite what it seems<br />

		<div class="lyrics">

		<p class="verse">
		If nothing else then smile<br />
		For we may be here awhile<br />
		Time will tell and then the tide fell<br />
		I've been waiting long for that bell
		</p>
		<p class="chorus"> 
		All I can see is what may have been the sun<br />
		The ribbons we bowed, the pillows we sewed have come undone<br />
		Fireflies and gilded skies issue through<br />
		The window I left open after you
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Collections I've culled from places I've known<br />
		I'm sorry to have left you alone<br />
		I try and try and try but I always win<br />
		I've always been ready to begin
		</p>
		<p class="bridge">
		It's a long way down<br />
		This landscape we've found<br />
		And it's ten miles through the ground<br />
		No wonder you're so tightly wound<br />
		So I will trust my feet<br />
		Feel the sand and feel the heat<br />
		It's the sound of expanse<br />
		A last and unknown
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
		Revolution never came<br />
		I don't feel that I'm to blame<br />
		The sound of travel is what I mean<br />
		Sunflower valleys I've seen
		</p>
		<p class="chorus"> 
		Songs are sung and jaws are dropped and tongues are raised<br />
		You left me broke with faerie folk I'd led astray<br />
		Excising this cyst you found the gist of my true wants<br />
		Someday we'll return smiling to our former haunts.

			<p>This was our first record. We finished it in May of 2003 and it came out sometime that summer. As you can see, it was done kind of all over the place. It served us well on our first tour, a two week trip through Oregon and Washington. Some of the songs were written a long time ago. <a href=""></a>
