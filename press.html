				<br>by Todd Weber</h3>

				<p>On their first national tour, Portland's At Dusk are having the time of their lives traveling to new places, visiting old friends and playing their challenging brand of rock to largely receptive audiences.  They're having enough fun that they're not even going to let a little street crime spoil things.
				<p>"It was an incident that was totally unrelated to our musical ventures," jokes At Dusk's Will, "but we were mugged at gunpoint in Washington D.C., and we lost our earnings from that city.  It was kind of unfortunate."
				<p>At Dusk recently released their second self-produced LP, "Heights," which was largely recorded in a middle school band room in their hometown.  By combining minimalist playing with intricate song structures, At Dusk could best be described as "indie prog."  From their hypnotic, off-kilter beats to their poetic lyrics, everything about this band seems very intellectual.  (One guy went to Yale, the other two went to highly regarded Reed College in Portland).  But given the melodic nature of the songs and the intriguing interplay of the musicians, you still don't have to be a brain surgeon or a philosopher to enjoy this music.  (Although an SAT score of at least 1,000 is recommended).
				<p>If these guys don't make it as a band, they stand a good chance of making their mark as writers.  Their tour log at their website (www.atduskmusic.com) is a fascinating and entertaining read about the adventures of three guys out on the road.  But for now, they're going to concentrate on writing songs and making music and are looking forward to their next recording project.
				<p>"We're very eager to start writing new material," says Will.  "As new as the record is, nothing makes songs older quicker than gigging them many nights a week for weeks on end."

				<a name="wavelength"><h3>Wavelength Zine<br>Interview
				<br>by Jonny Dovercourt</h3>

				<p>At Dusk hail from Portland, Oregon and play an amazingly detailed, luxuriantly catchy brand of post-punk pop -- with flecks of folky ambience -- that will remind you of all your favourite bands of all time. All three members responded to Jonny Dovercourt's questions via email:
				<h4>At Dusk: college rock or high school rock?</h4>
				<p>Cary Clarke: It seems to me that responding "high school rock" would intimate something that could lead to my arrest. But, damn it all, I choose it anyway! I think there's just less competition in the high school rock field. The three of us all grew up together, and began playing music together around the beginning of high school. At the risk of sounding nostalgic, I think there is a certain sense of possibility that I associate with high school, and I'd like to believe that the positive, fun aspects of that come through in our music. "College rock" sounds too laboured, too studious. Though perhaps there's still some territory to be explored in "post-grad rock".  Will Hattman: We try to bring to our music the kind of vitality that was so palpable and inspiring in the music to which we responded when we were impressionable teens. On these grounds, I'd call it high school rock. Greg Borenstein: I like the youthful energy and playfulness that implies: those qualities are definitely part of how we see ourselves. Not to mention the underage girls.
				<h4>The power trio format holds the most possibilities for sonic exploration. True or false? Discuss. </h4>
				<p>CC: Obviously three musicians can make fewer sounds at one time than four or five, or 15, as you Torontonians are used to these days. But there's just as much potential in sparseness as there is in density. I believe the semi-arbitrary setting of limitations is a prerequisite to making anything. You have to choose to do one thing and not another an infinite number of times in any creative act.. GB: I think we definitely have a little bit of an attitude about bands with more members. We will often remark, "What are all those guys doing?" and imagine how easy it would be to be the guy who, every couple minutes, goes "vreeeowwwwwwwerrrrrginginging" on the guitar.
				<h4>We live in Toronto, City of Neighbourhoods. You live in Portland, City of _______________? Enlighten us a bit about that blank.</h4>
				<p>CC: Portland, City of Neighbourhoods Not In Toronto. I thought that would be an amusingly obnoxious response. The experience I've had that most clearly represents to me the best aspects of Portland is the organization of the first annual PDXPOP Now! (www.pdxpopnow.com) music festival, which just took place a few weeks back. An online forum gave rise to a discussion about what we could do to create a stronger sense of community amongst all of the musicians in Portland. A group of about 14 of us met weekly for 7 months and put together a free, all-ages festival of 43 Portland bands. In addition, we put out a double-disc compilation of Portland music. The response was overwhelmingly positive. The CDs sold out before the event and we had amazing, supportive crowds for the festival. The whole thing was paid for by local business sponsorships. Portland is small enough to make organizing something like this possible, but is culturally active and diverse enough to make doing so worthwhile. It's worth noting that Portland is actually "The City of Roses". Even the cop cars have effeminate little roses on them. It's pretty cute. To compensate for this frilly image, they have to be extra aggressive.
				<h4>How did you find out about Wavelength? What are you looking forward to most about your visit to Toronto? </h4>
				<p>CC: All of the incredible music coming out of Toronto these days has lead us to not infrequently joke about moving there. Wavelength seems tremendously cool, with a similar ethic to PDXPOP Now! As if the music weren't enough, we're of course thrilled by the adventures promised by Toronto's reputation for world-class call girls and meth, which is really what we're all about. That and listening to dorky audio books in the tour van. WH: The Constantines, Toronto's own, had enthusiastically congratulated us on getting the show, describing it as a sort of bastion for all things indie, where people come for the music and pay attention. I'm rather embarrassed to admit that virtually all of what I know about Toronto I learned from The Conan O'Brien Show. So. . .I'm looking forward to back bacon on a bun, the CN Tower. . .I guess I can't go to  Leafs game. . .fraternizing with fellow Rush fans. . .Oh! Do you guys do that boiling-maple-syrup-packed-in-snow roadside dessert in the summertime as well? Maybe with artificial snow? GB: Also, using our incredibly rusty and broken school French.</p>

				<br>by Saby Reyes-Kulkarni</h3>

				<p>This Portland band insist they're not being facetious when they say they're influenced by Philip Glass and Romanian Gypsy music as much as by their more obvious indie- and post-rock antecedents. Despite their fluency in sounds that reflect the dour reserve typical of the latter, At Dusk distinguish themselves with a sunnier outlook, which they maintain even when their lyrics are nakedly revealing. Without overplaying their offhand sense of humor, songs with suggestive titles like "You Make Me Worry" and "Act of Violence" stay afloat instead of sinking under the weight of the band's attitude. A trio with one former music student and the two others with some formal training, At Dusk sound very much like students -- they poke, pluck and prod at horns, xylophones, cymbals, guitar strings and the like such that the craft in their writing recedes behind a veil of wonder but ultimately isn't lost.</p>

				<br>by Ian Mathers</h3>

				<p>At Dusk's vaguely disappointing The Summer Of Promises Kept luckily still had enough promise to make the band worth watching. So when Heights popped up in my mailbox I was torn between excitement and trepidation: Would the moments of wince-inducing tweeness be excised or embraced? Would they have more quasi-novelty songs like "I Am The Starman"? Would there be anything as haunting as "The Image"? The answers are: excised, no and yes (in spades). The group toured between albums and the experience has audibly toughened them up. Everything from their compositional skills to lead singer Cary Clarke's voice (reminiscent of Ed Robertson from the Barenaked Ladies, but in a good way) have matured and progressed; Heights gets more done in nine songs than the old record did in fourteen.</p>
		<p> 
		The first half of the album is more mellow and closer to At Dusk's past work, consisting of clean-limbed indie rock that, if the classic critical formula was used, would work out roughly to (Mission Of Burma + The Byrds) x Terror Twilight. But the crucial difference in the band's approach is already obvious; older songs strove so hard to be pretty that they wound up artlessly affected, whereas now the tunes are content to just be good, pretty or not. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Opener "Come Too Far" sounds much more natural, and the better touches of their earlier style (like drummer Will Hattman's excellent backing vocals) have been retained. It never lapses either lyrically or sonically into the self-conscious quirkiness that hung over At Dusk's older songs; their lyrical approach still balances a sense of optimism and nostalgia with occasional heavy doses of foreboding, but the disparate elements mesh better now. 
		</p>
		<p>
		But as enjoyable as the first side is, the four songs of the second side are the real highlights. "The Face Is That Of An Angel" is an effectively constrained burst of menace but the other three tracks stretch out past the six minute mark to great effect. "Act Of Violence" and "Tired Eyes" approach the epic through skillful application of some truly great choruses and focused instrumental parts that never lapse into formless jamming. 
		</p>
		<p>
		It's hard to structure longer songs like this without getting boring, but both succeed; "Act Of Violence" fakes you out with an almost stereotypically At Dusk-sounding guitar intro before abruptly shifting into a heavier and grimmer sound to kick off into the grimmest and clearest relationship song At Dusk have yet penned. The chorus manages to approximate a firestorm with just some extra percussion and strong bass work. It's not perfect -- the twenty second fade out into a false ending needs to be about a fourth as long -- but it's an utterly stunning piece of work and "Tired Eyes" does it one better. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This entire disc is available for download from At Dusk's website (linked above), but "Tired Eyes" is the one to check out. Reminiscent of Raising The Fawn's similarly superb The North Sea LP, just when you think the song is done with you it sucks you in again and tosses you around for a while. If I'd first heard the second half of Heights blind I don't know if I would have tagged it as At Dusk; the vocals (always a strong point) are still distinctive, but the sound has improved by leaps and bounds. 
		</p>
		<p>
		By the time At Dusk cheekily wave goodbye with "Welcome Home" ("we still have not changed the locks"), they've proved that "Tired Eyes" was no fluke. Given that one of the most frustrating parts of The Summer Of Promises Kept was its inconsistency, the level of quality control here is impressive. At Dusk have done what every band should do after a spotty record; focused, regrouped and hit the next one clean out of the park.

				<br>by Carla Costa</h3>

				<p>At Dusk's style of old-fashioned indie pop has points where it sparkles with mesmerizing melodies and intricate song structures.  But for every track that shines, there's one that's lackluster.  This record would work better as a stellar EP that maintained imagination rather than a full-length with too much filler.

				<br>by Marcel Feldmar</h3>

				<p>My first thought was something to do with the Olivia Tremor Control -- but nope -- I was wrong.  This is more like Mission of Burma (mentioned in the bio).  "The Summer" is upbeat and downbeat slightly math-touched pop rock, but with more depth than most bands.  When the mood hits deep, you can feel the ground rolling underneath you, and when the songs shift into more prog pop lilting brightness, you think maybe you can fly.  There are some elements of conceptual/psychedelic, but also some very strong and solid songwriting moments that make me feel like listening to June of 44, perhaps.

				<br>by <a href="mailto:jennifer@indie-music.com">Jennifer Layton</a></h3>

				<p>This CD requires more than one listen. The trio At Dusk isn't just a group of talented vocalists and musicians; they're also poets, dreamers, and intellectuals. Vocally, they have the innocent, harmoniously pure simplicity of The Association and The Byrds. Musically, they take rock/jazz fusion and swirl in orchestral sounds and theatrical surroundings. 
				<p>The lyrics should give you some idea of what we're dealing with here. From "Rain in the House": 
				<p>Eras/come again sweetly/The night is but a frame/This tiger is now tame/Purpose/A month without language/Violets in the rain/Our state is on the wane.
				<p>And so on. No, I have no idea what it means either, but such psychedelic poetry is perfect for the expansive, experimental music. At their darkest, they sound like they're playing in a dank castle at midnight. At their most uptempo, you'd expect to find them in a 1960s beatnik bar with Tim Buckley cheering them on from the rafters. 
				<p>Just when I think I know where the sound is going, they catch me off guard with an intriguing movement. "Up on Persephone" is a good example. The bass sings with the guitar, note for note, a hypnotic musical duet. The title track begins as a sigh and morphs into a jangly rock jam. We get instrumental dreams and blended vocal magic. You will never get bored listening to them, and you'll never figure out exactly what you're listening to. If you're smart, you'll just close your eyes and melt into the sound.

				<br>by <a href="http://www.southofmainstream.com/who.html">rockandrollgirl</a></h3>

				<p>At Dusk's full-length album The Summer of Promises Kept is rock with a hint of Euro-pop. This Oregon based threesome has succeeded in creating a catchy album to tantalize the masses.
				<p>The album carries an upbeat, happy feel with undertones of melancholy (as the title suggests). This was a unique venture for the band, because it seems that so many bands in this genre are excellent at being melancholy but fail at presenting happiness. The Summer of Promises Kept succeeds in presenting various emotions without sounding too happy-go-lucky or kill-yourself-melancholy, which is an accomplishment. Musically, the album carries hints of lo-fi, pop, rock, and at times, the slight hint of a jazzy almost swing sound. The vocals are appealing, with a lot of harmonizing between the two male singers. The lyrics were interesting, and suited the genre.
				<p>Overall, I thought the album was well presented and produced. At Dusk definitely has talent. I did find the various styles presented in the songs awkward at times and it made it somewhat difficult for me to get into the album, as I couldn't anticipate what the next sound would be. I don't mean to say unpredictability is bad; on the contrary, it is really important in a good CD, just that there were a bit too many unpredictable moments throughout the CD. This is just a small matter as I was able to thoroughly enjoy the album in spite of it. I know that overtime the band will get a more set style which will make their talents shine even brighter. If you like rock, or any of the other styles listed, check out this record.

				<p>I like indie rock as much as the next man. Actually, around here, I probably like indie rock more than the next man, unless they're William "Bloody" Swygart, our local parish priest of the Church Of The Almighty Bedsit. I once had a friend accuse me on a trip of having brought no albums that were not UK indie bands, and much to my chagrin he was right. 
				<p>So I'm not just reacting to At Dusk's new album on the basis of a dislike for this sort of music as a whole. Don't get me wrong, if you can't stand indie rock At Dusk are emphatically not going to change your mind. But even if you love the stuff The Summer Of Promises Kept is tough going. 
				<p>There are definitely songs where they get it right, and they're good enough to turn the album into a qualified success. 'Reid's Song' is practically a response to Teenage Fanclub's great b-side 'Broken', similarly mostly instrumental but ending in the lines "I don't believe you're so lonely/I don't believe you're the only". 'Seventeen Fever Dream' is an actual instrumental, and the guitar interplay there is compelling. 'The Image' possesses a sense of drive most of the album lacks and the elliptical (to be generous) lyrics work for one. The title track is lovely indeed, a quiet intro swelling into laid-back sighing harmonies and a great chorus (even if the reference to "beaches and canyons" and thus to Black Dice was a mistake).
				<p>But even at the best these songs can remind you of the worst on display here, where some of the stylistic choices turn into annoyances and worse. 'Sports' is the worst offender, reminding me why "twee" is sometimes used as a form of derision. Additionally, there is, and I don't say this lightly, too much falsetto on this record, while the device of having the main instrumental melody follow the vocal line is also found in abundance (not a good thing). At its worst, then, The Summer Of Promises Kept isn't just lackluster, it's annoying. There are experiments that don't work ('East/West Party'), an execrable "hidden track" that is clearly listed as such ('I Am The Starman'), and absurd melodrama ('Rain In The House'). 
				<p>Bassist Greg Borenstein's 'When You're Far Away' is a perfect example of the problem with At Dusk on this album, and also of their promise. The song itself is fine, a quiet, slowly building track. But it's ruined by the jarring inclusion of "Lai dai dai dai dai" as a placeholder line. Jarring because the first time I heard the song I thought he was singing "come back to my room/die die die die die die". It's not the big picture that winds up holding back At Dusk, as they've got talent and potential to spare. It's the little things. As it is, there's a great EP here, and all of it does grow on you with more exposure. That plus the fact that they say on their website (http://www.atduskmusic.com/) "If you'd like a copy of the whole album, email us your mailing address and we'll send one out to you for free right away" means they're worth giving a try if you're into this indie stuff, or at least watching in the future.

				<br>on <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/popscene/">Popscene</a></h3>

				<p>Lets start off with something positive: I'll give you a list of the things some people will like about this disk. At Dusk are at the forefront of the math-rock revival. Every riff sounds like its trajectory had to be precisely calculated with a slide rule. This is post-something of the highest order and a perfect reflection of some corners of the indie scene at present. Stick Connor posters definitely line the floors of these boys and Sunday is for attending the Church of Tortoise. Everything's in the right place, and fans of snappy piccolo sounding snare drums will love this one. One of the top five best self-releases I've heard this year.
					</p>
				<p>These fuckers have heard the Stooges and Velvets (maybe all their records), but they sure don't get 'um. They think the Stones are overrated and have never heard of Brian Jones (probably not even BJM). Is the goal of these guys to bore the hell out of us? I just don't see the point. There are no hooks on this record, and it isn't bracing or mind-blowing either. I think it should be a requirement for any group to put one of its snare hits as the first track of any LP. That would save poor bastards like me a lot of time.

				<br>by Philip Buchan</h3>

				<p>At last it's here. The reconciliation of aggression and beauty, the wedlock-borne child of punk and pop, the perfect illustration of the whole gentle as doves/wise as serpents concept -- and it sounds great. I saw something special brewing in the At Dusk camp when I reviewed their self-titled EP for Splendid awhile back, and now, with this full-length, I have a full understanding of what I was at first only slightly cognizant of. In addition to the six songs that were on that EP, these three gentlemen have penned eight more better songs that marry an array of influences in a way that I'm willing to say hasn't quite been done before. It's daring, in an age where there are 578 bands in every city and only about 30 that anyone ever hears about, to assume that I've got any sort of finger on the pulse of rock and roll, but I feel there's truly some substance to my belief in At Dusk's supreme creativity.
				<p>First, however, a note -- this is not the Greatest Band Alive or anything of that sort. This isn't even the best album of the year. The songs are excellent and diligently constructed, but I can think of many more derivative tunes by other acts that carry more emotional resonance. At Dusk has their share of kinks to work out, but with their ever-developing fresh approach, things will only improve in due time.
				<p>Indeed, as is the case when humans do anything, At Dusk makes flawed music, and I'm going to assume that you, the reader, listen to lots of music made by humans and are willing to forgive the band for their mortal imperfection. I'm also willing to bet that you've grown weary of hearing Fugazi or The Beatles or Pavement or My Bloody Valentine rehashed for the thousandth time, and there's a good chance that many of your favorite bands that currently exist in 2003 are doing just that. Doing it well, perhaps, but still doing it. And At Dusk isn't. Instead, they've found a way to blend angular '80s post-punk with sunny, orchestral pop. Battering ram drums do battle with Beach Boys harmonies, jagged guitar strumming is leveled off with an organ and a glockenspiel, and propulsive bass lines meet their match in joyous melodies. It's the emotional yet minimalist approach of Joy Divison, the rhythmic playfulness of The Talking Heads, and the childlike whimsy of A Charlie Brown Christmas rolled into songs that play like cohesive essays. It looks ludicrous on paper, and sounds even sillier on your stereo, and yet it all comes together logically in the end. Contrasting elements are rarely welded into coherent, transcendent songs, but At Dusk pulls it off with flying colors.

				<h3>Review of "The Summer of Promises Kept"
				<br>by Sean Padilla</h3>

				<p>The fact that this CD popped up in my mailbox was a happy coincidence. I read a review of this Portland trio's earlier self-released EP on another website, and was prompted to check out their IUMA site. Once there, I downloaded "I Am the Starman" and "Seventeen Fever Dreams," both of which appear on their debut full-length, The Summer of Promises Kept. "Starman" is a two-minute miracle, an acoustic song that has all of the simplicity, catchiness, and spontaneity of mid-1990s Guided by Voices. It is worth noting that the liner notes of Promises say that "Starman" was "recorded, mixed, and mastered by At Dusk all at once." "Seventeen Fever Dreams," on the other hand, is an electric, professionally recorded instrumental that eschews anything remotely close to pop. All three musicians play in different time signatures, and the two guitarists play in different keys. Such gratuitous and grating dissonance might work in the hands of a band like US Maple or the Curtains, but At Dusk simply can't pull it off. "Starman" and "Fever Dreams" clearly delineate the extremes of this band's sound, which brings me to the double-edged sword this CD presents me with. 
				<p>On one hand, At Dusk are three guys who sing and play well, know their indie-rock history, and have a grasp of melody strong enough to ensure that almost all of their songs have one killer hook, as well as the versatility to ensure that no two songs sound exactly alike. On the other hand, they're three guys who can let their instrumental prowess get the better of them, don't spend enough time in the studio to truly perfect their songs, and haven't quite settled on a distinct sound yet. However, when At Dusk gets it right, they get it REALLY right. The songs in which the scales are tipped more toward melody and structure than dissonance and angularity are the clear standouts. 
				<p>For instance, there's "Sports," a speedy Wedding Present-style strum-a-thon in which glockenspiel and falsetto singing usher in what could've been a drab rock song into a new level of beauty. Then, there's "The Image," a song about nightmares that benefits from great guitar work and a spastic drum-driven coda. It's what Sebadoh would've sounded like if they took as many cues from Slint and Karate as they did from Minor Threat and Nick Drake. "When You're Far Away" is a Microphones song in all but name, as an intentionally off-key and ham-fisted acoustic intro slowly builds up to a crescendo of bells, organs, and drums. Last but not least, there's the title track, which sports some wonderful three-part harmony and spells out the album's underlying lyrical theme. 
				<p>"This is a prayer for what can't be said," guitarist Cary Clarke and drummer Will Hattman sing, "for all that we've hoped for and done instead." Throughout many of the songs (at least the ones that don't rely on vague, melancholy cliches), there is a sense of optimism in the face of adverse circumstances. If the title of "What May Have Been the Sun" doesn't give it all away to you, the song's opening lines will: "If nothing else, then smile, for we may be here for a while." Other songs ("The Deep End," "Titled Floors") lament being stuck in cycles and endlessly repeating the same mistakes. Lyrically, At Dusk have a fairly even ratio of signal to noise. The aforementioned songs in this paragraph definitely belong in the "signal" category, whereas in other songs ("Up on Persephone," "Rain in the House") they stretch their conceits further than they can reasonably go. 
				<p>There are many songs that would be up there with "Sports" and "The Image" if it weren't for one or two detracting elements. Some otherwise tuneful songs have brief tangents of "Fever Dreams"-style atonality that disrupt the momentum, and others are marred by vocals that could've used a couple more practice takes. I get the feeling that they didn't really give themselves enough time to edit and record their songs. Trust me, guys: wrong notes don't necessarily make your songs more challenging or interesting, and only certain bands can get away with them. You're not one of them. Also, if you're going to make "I Am the Starman" your HIDDEN TRACK, why would you list the song as "Hidden Track: I Am the Starman" in bold print THREE DIFFERENT PLACES on the CD's artwork? If you announce its presence, guys, then it can't really be hidden! Overall, though, The Summer of Promises Kept is a good start, and hopefully next time around At Dusk will have enough money and/or time to iron out the kinks, settle on what kind of band they actually want to BE, and deliver a great sophomore effort.

				<br>by John Wenzel</h3>

				<p>At Dusk is an appropriate name; this is the kind of music created in the twilight hours of an arduous day. It's smart indie rock with a dark-tinged melodic undertone, but it's full of distractions.
				<p>Too many distractions. Boatloads of 'em. I hate to write these guys off as "quirky," because they write memorable, jangly instrumentals. The math rock-y drums match '90s indie guitars agreeably, accenting crisply-played notes like a drum student on a final exam. Unfortunately, these guys need a new singing style. Breathy, sensitive and stretched thin over awkward lyrics, the vocals frequently miss their mark. It'd be okay if they weren't aiming for anything, but it's obvious they're trying to reach some sort of Posies/Sloan harmony-plateau.
				<p>There's so much potential to rock out, so many near-interesting ideas, you wonder what would happen if At Dusk just let loose. But they do too much in too little time, tripping over themselves and not learning from it.
				<p>It's admirable they recorded, mixed and mastered this by themselves. In the end, though, it only matters if you want to listen to it more than a couple times, which is difficult. Too indie for Vagrant, too rough for Polyvinyl, At Dusk sounds like they're imitating something. The Inbreds, maybe? Early '90s Sebadoh? What are they trying to do on this record? I don't care enough to figure it out.

				<br>by Erick Mertz</h3>

				<p>When last I left At Dusk, I suggested they take their music back to the kitchen for more seasoning. I feared that the coaster they'd sent along with the disc would be the only lasting effect they would have on me. As The Summer of Promises Kept arrived, I wondered if there was any chance that they had indeed hit the spice rack and seasoned what was honestly an ordinary disc. 
				<p>In a word, promises kept. 
				<p>The work on The Summer of Promises Kept shows a marked sonic improvement over their earlier self-titled release. The songs are snappier and the recording values are deeper, further developed than before with enough ambiances for a double disc. The echoing effect on "Rain In The House" feels like it was recorded in an old Victorian manor. Pleasantly, "Pain" rolls over instrumentally, clean and assured; it is the best song on The Summer of Promises Kept by a nose over a pocketful of other contenders. At their best, At Dusk is one catchy threesome here, sounding sonically similar to earlier DIY era The Flaming Lips, before the concept of world domination came to them. 
				<p>With these elements, and the marked ability to assert musically, the prospect of another At Dusk disc is suddenly an inviting one.

				<br>drb</h3>

				<p>This album starts out with enough definition that you really think it's going to get somewhere. Unfortunately it never seems to arrive. The band gets close a few times and there are some very interesting bits throughout, but I couldn't seem to find a song that fully panned out to what these former High School chums seem to be trying to accomplish. There is good musicianship throughout but the recording is so clean that it provokes thoughts of a sterile operating room converted into a recording studio. The music generally never really found a deep enough groove to sell the pop-iness that the lyrics and arrangements seem to profess to. The opening track The Deep End, is likely the high point, a song almost catchy enough to get stuck in your head. I was happily surprised to find the bass as prominent as it is throughout the album, yet found myself hoping for a little more change-up to some usually monotonous, though occasionally complex riffs. It's ok and interesting to let a tone ring out a little before cutting it off or, to add an extra note here and there guys. Both bass and guitar could benefit from this advice. On tracks like The Image the main guitar riff almost grabs you but when you realize how precise it is, any emotional response is soon lost. The music in general reminds me of a guitarist I once played with who's greatest downfall was wanting things too perfect. I was happy to hear a few instrumental tracks as the vocals tended to get on my nerves a little and distracted me from enjoying the music. I'm a big fan of 3 part harmony and indie pop-y vocals and lyrics, but many songs reminded me of a bad musical, too many chorus's with a speak and response echo to them and absurdly obscure or blatantly obvious word and phrasing choices. You get the feeling that the vocals are really trying to tell you something but aren't coherent enough to motivate you to care. These guys could make a few changes and improve their sound drastically. Adding a TINY bit more garage sloppiness and trying to say a little less would be a step in the right direction. In general, get a little less serious and more musically free. Maybe add another vocalist to front the band, especially on the mic. Who knows; change the recipe in the right way and I might even become a fan. I get the feeling, like At Dusk, I'm already halfway there.

		At Dusk is a thoroughly interesting band. Their record has a very light air about it, and it lures my ears and brain. Truthfully, I didn't like it at first. But I gave it a listen, and another, and another. Everytime I listened, I liked it more and more. I know that our sometimes anonymous, and sometimes missing-in-action music reviewer co-hort Shaelee would like this record a lot.
		At times, this record makes me nod my head in sync, and at times it makes me drift away into my own thoughts, my own mind. Sometimes, it makes me want to lie down and just relax, let life be and absorb. I really respect this band. Their approach to music is really refreshing.
		I have decided that I like EVERYTHING about this band. Indie-pop rock stuff thats is just good wholesome sound. I can't really explain them. The best I can do is tell you to listen to the sample song. They are moderately slow, and they aren't annoying whining or distorted muck. It's something that if you give it a good chance, you could possible have a deep epiphany, or maybe just drift off into your own reality. I hope you like it.

				<p>Vocals reminiscent of Morrissey and music reminiscent of Sonic Youth and Mission of Burma, At Dusk can be either cuddly or cheesy, depending on your tolerance to soft-vocalled (but not emo) indie-pop. I personally dig it  they're not so much emotional as simply pleasant. It makes a nice soundtrack to a summer afternoon, and doubles as a decent makeout album.</p>

				<br>By Phillip Buchan</h3>


				<p>I may put my manhood in question by saying this, but At Dusk have released a cute little EP. There's a pretty little picture of flowers on the front -- tulips, I believe -- hand-drawn and colored in with magic marker. The lyric sheet is a folded piece of standard white paper, cut by hand, and it's just adorable how you can see where the band cut outside the lines here and there. On the back, there's a precious little duck -- and best of all, it says "At Duck" underneath that precious little quacker! Why, I bet their moms and kindergarten teachers are proud -- it's all so sweet, so innocent, so heartfelt... but when you hit the play button, you'll be caught unawares by At Dusk's straight-faced rock and roll.</p>
				<p>These three gentlemen are tough at heart, but that's not to say that some of the artwork's qualities don't transfer to the music; chinks in the band's post-punk armor reveal an unassuming, introverted character and a knack for penning sunny harmonies. The flowers and duckies aren't an ironic front as much as the coy yin to the music's minor key yang, with subtle hints of each appearing in the other. It's hard to tell whether At Dusk is an indie pop band with an abrasive punk heart or vice versa, but either way, the results are quite pleasing.</p>
				<p>"What May Have Been the Sun" lays out everything you need to know in the album's first five minutes: drums, bass and guitar feed off of one another in a symbiotic manner and the calmly assertive vocals create a sweet lullaby-melody, both in chorus and in verse. The song escapes long-windedness on the strength of its hook and the guitar track's balance of delicacy and ferocity. The next four songs follow a similar route, shining in detail and subtlety without getting too nebulous; imagine Q and Not U battling slight depression in a rainy northwestern climate and you'll be on the right track. "East/West Party" is the wildcard -- the band inches dangerously close to dance-punk territory. Angular guitar strokes and silky basslines get the groove going, and the addition of handclaps is an almost excessively overt invitation to free your ass and let your mind follow. But after only a couple of vocal lines, the song ends -- well before the party can get started. It's strange stuff, but somehow more fun than frustrating.</p>
				<p>Like any young band, At Dusk has room to improve, possibly by a little tempered complexity or more meaningful lyrics, but this EP should not be taken as a work in progress -- it's strong enough to stand on its own, cuteness, duck and all.</p>

				<br />By Erick Mertz</h3>
				<p>Portland, Oregon trio At Dusk's self-titled EP starts off a little clumsy, and from there it threatens to get interesting but never really does. Whether it's the vocals lacking wit that trips the threesome or the bland instrumentation I'm unsure, but regarding the short 6 song disk, I fear it may be a combination of both. 

		Whatever it is - or isn't, as the case may be - this one needs to be put back for further seasoning. 

		"Up On Persephone" isn't catchy for long enough to be catchy; cool, but not cool enough to be cool is "Titled Flowers (Were All We Have)." Good pieces are abundant on this disk, but they aren't bound in the tight succession necessary to make a cohesive release. Having said that, the production is spot on, featuring some of the most fantastic mixing values I've heard on a D.I.Y. release. 

		It isn't enough here; perhaps, though, it's a start.
