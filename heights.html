		<h3><a name="come_too_far">Come Too Far</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/199.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
			I Set a course for November<br />
			We'll beat everyone else there, no doubt about it<br />
			I'm the group's final member<br />
			The roster has been stripped bare<br />
			I nearly shouted, "I'm the one with all the answers<br />
			They fall from my lips like ash, and touch on nothing"<br />
			So be aware of silent dancers<br />
			'Cause lately there's been a rash of fingers touching
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
			I could watch as the sun sets down in your eyes<br />
			I could do with a year without goodbyes<br />
			I could watch as the stars come out in your eyes<br />
			I can count all the stars<br />
			But have we come too far?<br />
			And will these doubts be the last that there are?<br />
			Are they?<br />
			I pray they are
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			Through the storm and the rosebush<br />
			My fever will try to break and come up short<br />
			My feet collapse and my toes push on bottoms of emptied lakes<br />
			The numbers report: I've run out of excuses<br />
			My vacation's run its course and left me tired<br />
			Our dreams have run out of uses<br />
			And brought us a deep remorse in which we're mired
		</p>
		</div>
		<h3><a name="we_could_do_anything">We Could Do Anything</a></h3>
		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/200.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">	
		<p class="verse">
			The sky was clear<br />
			Sun in the wind<br />
			And by the shore<br />
			Wading in the shallows<br />
			Hoping my feet would freeze<br />
			Expecting life from rain
		</p>
		<p class="pre-chorus">
			We dodged the white spray of sprinklers<br />
			Pastel pink pursuit of joy<br />
			Visible through glassless windows<br />
			Full of stars and darkened sky
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
			We went to swim<br />
			Be taken in<br />
			Clamber and climb<br />
			Shimmer and shine<br />
			We could do anything outside at night<br />
			We could do anything it would feel right<br />
			We could do anything I think we might
		</p>
		<p class="bridge">
			We meant to stay the night<br />
			Find out what it's like inside<br />
			Before you went away<br />
			We had our intentions right<br />
			Yet another thing we never did<br />
			Seeing what would come of this<br />
			If I find the place we hid<br />
			Something small is what I miss<br />
			Then driving away<br />
			Wishing to stay<br />
		<p class="pre-chorus">
			There was water under our feet<br />
			Surface glowing beige and white<br />
			Watching while the shore's receding<br />
			Seeing things against the sky
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			Still in our clothes<br />
			Last of the warmth<br />
			Sand in our toes<br />
			Comfort and contentment<br />
			Muddled and cloudy sky<br />
			This is not what I chose
		</p>
		<p class="coda">
			Outside at night<br />
			It would feel right<br />
			Marking your flight<br />
			Underwear's white<br />
			We could do anything<br />
			Edge of the light<br />
			I think we might<br />
			Feel it feel tight<br />
			Finding your height<br />
			We could do anything
		</p>

		<p><a href="http://media.mfdz.com/track/201.mp3">mp3</a></p>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
			I tend to spend my days waiting for the hurricanes to cease<br />
			You watch the weather change and wait to paint your mutant masterpiece<br />
			The summer breaks my fall<br />
			The winter's in a hurry<br />
			And in all honesty, you make me worry
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			The night I met you I had other plans I had to put to rest<br />
			I stood before you and you had me thinking I had passed the test<br />
			It's just a package deal<br />
			No judge without a jury<br />
			And in all honesty, you make me worry
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
			I've waited all night<br />
			It doesn't feel right to keep going backwards<br />
			And the end of the line, I see nothing but signs that say "stop going backwards"
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			The more I think about it, the less convinced I am that you're from earth<br />
			I think you've been into this nonsense since its accidental birth<br />
			The past is mardi gras<br />
			The future's awful blurry<br />
			And in all honesty, you make me worry
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			The last time I saw Jesus he told me not to listen to your mouth<br />
			It's where you keep your tongue,<br />
			It's dripping poison and always pointed south<br />
			You make a fetish of your sweet provincial fury<br />
			And in all honesty, you make me worry
		</p>

			Pick up where we<br />
			Left everything

		<p class="verse">
			I don't think that we've grown old<br />
			In spite of intervening years<br />
			It's just that we've had different jobs<br />

		<div class="lyrics">
		<p class="verse">
			I remember waking up at 6 am<br />
			The sweat had soaked into the mattress<br />
			When I flung the sheets away I woke you up<br />
			You never were much of an actress, but nevertheless<br />
			I had never felt that way in my whole life<br />
			My eyes alive, my body freezing<br />
			And I just assumed that it had been a dream<br />
			But maybe I just stopped believing
		</p>
		<p class="pre-chorus">
			Every day we sing ourselves the same old song<br />
			And we've kept the picture rolling for so long<br />
			Forgive me if from time to time it seems too much<br />
			It's just a passing feeling<br />
			On a night like that I could go either way<br />
			In the morning usually I feel OK<br />
			At least that's what I tell myself when all else fails
		</p>
		<p class="chorus">
			I don't believe in destiny, so what's so paralyzing?<br />
			I thought you felt the same as me, or were you compromising?<br />
			With every word the planet shakes<br />
			With every tear I'm silenced<br />
			I thought you felt the same as me<br />
			We are an act of violence
		</p>
		<p class="verse">
			I could never bring myself to tell you this<br />
			The atmosphere is too confusing<br />
			If this is a game we play night after night,<br />
			how do I tell winning from losing?<br />
			The heartbreaking thing is if I didn't think that we could still share breath<br />
			There'd be no reason to continue<br />
			But no matter how much sleep I lost to sweat,<br />
			my life is still bound up within you

			I've kissed you in a hundred dreams and every one has turned out wrong

			<p>This is our second record.  It is called Heights. Were anyone to have heard it yet, they would most likely think it quite executive!   Don't would you?  We think that there is audible growth on this record in all respects: songwriting, musicianship, track length and bone density.  If two aspects of At Dusk presented themselves alternately on The Summer of Promises Kept without ever really being fused -- the melodic indie popitude (e.g. Starman) vs. playful angular madness (e.g. Seventeen Fever Dreams) -- then we'd like to believe that Heights showcases the synthesis of those two At Dusks on every song.  Contiguous made continuous.
					<p>Heights was recorded under the skillful, patient, and sometimes unintelligible, guidance of <a href="http://dtrl.blogspot.com/">Chris Anderson</a> in two discrete bursts.  Having lived with us during The Summer of Promises Kept, Chris chose to move back to his hometown of Austin, TX as we began to write new material.  Consequently, our recording time was largely dictated by his ability to get sufficient time and funds.  We're bad at making decisions, so it's just as well that some temporal order was imposed on us.  Might I suggest a game such as you might find in Highlights magazine?  See if you can guess which songs were recorded together, and which set came when.
					<p>The first set of 5 tracks was recorded in a room in our practice space at NWRS in Portland's Northwest Industrial District in November 2003.  The room in question is not the one we rent, but was vacant at the time and less regularly shaped.  We set up in there for a weekend and knocked out what we'd written over the summer since pressing SoPK.  The weather was cold and the sun absent, leading us to lovingly working-dub this series of tunes The Blizzard of Forgotten Hope in answer to our bygone youthful optimism.
					<p>Chris then departed, leaving us to mull over the basic tracks and strategize a bit how best to augment them.  We'd never before had this kind of schedulish luxury.  We would hole up in the practice space (our own room this time) for entire nights and knock out overdubs that, by and large, worked out pretty well and made it onto the final album.  In some cases, we even went so far as to replace old parts with new ones -- a Wilsonian decadence we wouldn't have dreamed of but a year ago.  Meanwhile, we spent our Spring '04 touring for the first time (a two-week jaunt around the Northwest), wroting the second set of Heights songs, completing our music thesis, and co-organizing the PDXPOP Now!
					<p>We lured Chris to Portland with hyper-compressed recordings of our new songs recorded on our camcorder, as well as with grossly-inflated legends of acquiring some spending money.  Chris came for the two final weeks of May to accomplish a Herculean labor with us -- record basic tracks for our 4 new songs, record overdubs for them, record vocals for everything and mix the whole mess.  Much sleep was not had.  Much fun was, as Chris knows that putting killing in animals is what animals is liking.  Figure that out, cuz we're 2/3 vegetarian.
					<p>As fate would have it, destiny made luck go our way, to our good fortune.  That is to say, the good will of our friends and colleagues made this madness possible.  Having acquired some new gear, we borrowed amazing monitors from our friend and master-man, <a href="http://www.spleenlessmastering.com/" target="new">Jon Cohrs</a>, and semi-secretly recorded our basic tracks in the amazingly non-parallel band room at Gregory Heights Middle School on NE Portland, where our roommate and friend Ethan Chessin was marshalling the school band, the State of Oregon having failed to do so itself.  We were well cared for by the after school staff -- <a href="http://www.sunschools.org/" target="new">SUNfolk</a>, janitors, passing vagrants -- and knocked out a track a day.  Then, somehow, in a fit of delirium, we recorded all our vocals, all of our overdubs and mixed the album over the course of the second week.  Chris had so much fun, he's moving back!  That's just the kind of fun time you can expect from us.
					<p>And that brings us to now: Friday, June 18 2004.  We'll be turning over our Cohrsified master to Cravedog tomorrow, and we'll have 1,000 of these bad boys to figure out what to do with.  Likely, we will try and sell them to you.  We will bring them on tour with us across the nation.  We shall send them to the far corners of the earth to be written about -- Khabarovsk, Ouagadougou, Yellow Knife, and The Sydney Opera House.  We will find you.  We hope you're not too sad about that.</p>
