				<p class="verse">
					I give, I give my perfect plan away
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
					Whooooooooo!<br/>
					In the background<br/>
					In the background<br/>
					No up or down<br/>
					In the background
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
					My body makes the same mistakes again
				</p>
				<p class="coda">
					Oh, your precious heart is breaking<br />
					Why must I stand in line all the time?

				<p class="verse">
					There's such a lack of time now, such a lack of time now<br />
					It's something I've been thinking about, something I've been not talking about too much now <br />
					Something I just know is true, do you?<br />
					I've been keeping it mum, I've been keeping it quiet<br />
					But I think it's time I say it aloud now, say it aloud
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
					Under <br />
					Prepared and slept<br />
					It's no wonder<br />
					Wish I was younger and<br />
					<br/>
					Thunder<br />
					Would sound<br />
					Rain come down to soften<br />
					Aging too often	
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
					This is the end of our youth<br />
					Lost our last baby tooth<br />
					And we're tired<br />
					Our bones are growing thin<br />
					Loose as they are in our skin<br />
					I'm still waiting to begin, I'm still waiting to begin

			<div class="lyrics">
				<p class="verse">
				The way it goes, you take a step and follow through<br />
				And gentle noises come home to roost<br />
				And on the map this site is marked<br />
				A thousand decisions made in the dark
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				Flight, a word, a female word<br />
				With eyes that trace a lifetime in reverse<br />
				The swollen belly-fears of sleep<br />
				Psychotic desires that you can keep
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
				The way you used to feel at night made me do it<br/>
				The way, the way, the way you chip away
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				Stalks and flowers<br/>
				That you stood underneath<br/>
				Walked for hours<br/>
				The longer we walked on the closer we came to
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				Making good on<br/>
				What we knew to be true<br/>
				Ten years ago when<br/>
				We met and had our first debate
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
				Today is just until night fades right through it<br/>
				The way, the way, the way you slip away
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
				The way you used to feel at night made me do it<br/>
				The way, the way, the way you chip away
				</p>
				
				<p class="bridge">
				We're growing older<br/>
				Our friends all keep moving on<br/>
				While we remain here<br/>
				I hope it's no been to long<br/>
				<br />
				No matter worry<br/>
				Or things we cannot control<br/>
				The outcomes nothing<br/>
				The doing is its own goal
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				Let it smolder<br/>
				We're of different design<br/>
				Grow no bolder<br/>
				This fabric is holding it's far from unfolding<br/>
				<br/>
				Into tatters<br/>
				Which matters if laughter is any clue as to<br/>
				How through we are before we're done<br/>
				<p class="verse">
				Face, the same old face I used to smell<br/>
				The neck connected for sure can tell<br/>
				The tingled spine and crooked arms<br/>
				The body's mysterious bad-luck charms<br/>
				<br/>
				What pray tell keeps running me off the road<br/>
				An antediluvian moral code<br/>
				A fear that love is more than chance<br/>
				And I'm not just a victim of circumstance
				</p>

				Hood and camera <br />

				<p class="chorus"> 
				We sever, we sever<br/>
				I never, I never<br/>
				Could hope to believe that we're in this together<br/>

				We're betting it's better<br/>
				Untied and untethered<br/>
				We're leaning on you and you're light as a feather<br/>

				Remember, remember<br/>
				A day in september<br/>
				We're coming to you for each coal and each ember

				We bring just bread and water<br/>
				Something better to offer<br/>
				For your wives and your daughters

				<p class="verse">
				Scorched and scattered<br/>
				Scorched and scattered<br/>
				Walk away then one by one
				</p>
				<p class="coda">
				Give back the gulf stream war<br/>
				Give back the gulf stream war<br/>
				Return the sheath to sword<br/>
				Repair the page you tore<br/>
				No shutters anymore<br/>
				It's too hard to ignore<br/>
				Give back the gulf stream war<br/>
				Give back the gulf stream war

				After all I've been through<br />
				I don't care if it's true<br />
				I've just got to believe it<br />

				I'm still standing alive<br />
				Weathered all you contrived<br />
				I'm a plane crash survivor<br />
				<br />
				Will you still know my face<br />

				A year is quite a long passage<br />
				<br />
				Here are my wooden teeth<br />
				Here is my wooden tongue<br />
				Knew that you had to leave<br />
				But knew not for how long<br />
				<br />
				You know that you've been away

				<p class="verse">	
				So it's another long dance<br />
				A time to recognize my skin<br />
				And every cat-and-mouse-trap<br />
				That I'm so keen on falling in<br />
				The timing's far from perfect<br />
				The patchwork's working itself through<br />
				I've seen your eyes from two sides<br />
				How can they seem both old and new?
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
				You wanna say that you'll do it, you wanna say that you'll do it<br />
				That seems enough for now,<br />
				You wanna say that you'll do it, and after all you've been through it<br />
				That seems enough for now, that seems enough for now
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				I feel I've come to know you<br />
				From the impression in your chair<br />
				It's given me a slow taste<br />
				Of how a normal form prepares<br />
				To take advantage of one<br />
				Night or another with four arms<br />
				Four legs and two locked muscles<br />
				That come apart like balls of yarn<br />

				Won't you, won't you tell me<br />
				Won't you, won't you tell me

				Steppin' away from the door<br />
				You're runnin', you're runnin' out<br />
				Steppin' away from the door<br />
				You're runnin', you're runnin' out<br />
				Asking the heavens for more<br />
				They're runnin', they're runnin' out<br />
				Asking the heavens for more<br />

				<p class="verse">
				For the first time since we were<br/>
				Something new and incomplete<br/>
				I feel sure of where we stand<br/>
				Though I can't just pick up my feet<br/>
				Simply leave what I have built<br/>
				Too much guilt would hinder me<br/>
				Though my knees shake my feet are still where they will to be
                </p>
				<p class="verse">
				I would like to take the time<br/>
				To apologize for my<br/>
				Inability to choose<br/>
				I could use some help of some kind<br/>
				Insincere as that may seem<br/>
				It is clear to me that we<br/>
				Can assure each other that we can recover
                </p>
				<p class="pre-chorus">
				Not dark yet<br/>
				Towards sunset<br/>
				Warm breath of sugared air<br/>
				The place where we met<br/>
				<br/>
				In low light<br/>
				Fear we might<br/>
				A wet fist full of lawn<br/>
				Field in the cold night<br/>
				<br/>
				And after<br/>
				Rotted rafter<br/>
				I'm bracing for the end<br/>
				You shake with laughter<br/>
				<br/>
				One last thing<br/>
				Just wondering<br/>
				Where all the girls have gone<br/>
				The hearth is crumbling
				</p>
				<p class="chorus">
				Go forward now, and leave all the rust alone, I'm thinking<br />
				For once I should become a soldier for what I know
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				In pursuit of lost time let's<br />
				Not forget there's no such thing<br />
				And we might as well accept<br />
				Where we are and where we have been<br />
				I'm afraid that packing up<br />
				I could leave some things I need<br />
				I don't see advantage in having no strategy
				</p>
				<p class="verse">
				I'm engineered for romance but restricted to philosophy<br />
				This information blown from brain to brain's become beleaguering
				</p>	
				<p class="chorus">
				Close doors all day, and I'll walk into a solid wall, if I could<br/>
				Turn off my brain, I'd redesign what I can't recall
				</p>
				<p class="coda">
				Home<br />
				Has hid me well<br />
				I'm overgrown<br />
				With chaparral<br />				
				Just as the sun will set and come up on again then
